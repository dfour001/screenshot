# screenshot
A very simple python script that will take a screenshot and save as jpg when a selected key is pressed.

I wanted to be able to take multiple screenshots in a row without needing to worry about saving them, so I created this script.  It will take a screenshot of the entire screen and save it as a jpg in the same folder as the py file.  It is currently configured to take and save a screenshot when the print screen button is pressed, but that is easily changed by updating the key variable.
